# eAE transmart plugin.


The eAE project is part of the [eTRIKS Analytical Environement (eAE)](https://eae.doc.ic.ac.uk/) project.

This project is a plugin for tranSMART to access the eAE back end. It is part of the 1.0 release of the eAE project.

At the moment, it includes three analytics with their associated visualizations:

1. The Cross-Validation analysis pipeline aims at providing an unbiased approach for automated model generation and validation.

2. The General Testing statistical analysis pipeline aims at providing statistical insights about the datasets for further research, without any prior statistical knowledge, by performing multiple statistical tests on a given data set.

3. The Pathway Enrichment analysis pipeline is a method to identify classes of genes  that are over-represented in a large set of pathways. It relies on [Fisher's exact test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_exact_test) and [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/).

All those analytics are available in the [tranSMART platform](https://github.com/transmart/transmartApp) under the eTRIKS Analytics tab.
